try {
  await controller.initialize();
  controller.play();
} catch (e) {
  // Handle initialization errors
  print('Video initialization failed: $e');
}
```

### Enhanced UI with Chewie

```dart
// 1. Create Chewie controller
final chewieController = ChewieController(
  videoPlayerController: controller,
  autoPlay: false,
  looping: false,
  allowFullScreen: true,
  allowMuting: true,
);

// 2. Display with rich controls
Chewie(controller: chewieController)
```

### Advanced Features with Better Player

```dart
// 1. Configure better player
final betterPlayerDataSource = BetterPlayerDataSource(
  BetterPlayerDataSourceType.network,
  'https://example.com/stream.m3u8',
  videoFormat: BetterPlayerVideoFormat.hls,
);

// 2. Create controller with advanced options
final betterPlayerController = BetterPlayerController(
  BetterPlayerConfiguration(
    autoPlay: false,
    looping: false,
    aspectRatio: 16 / 9,
  ),
  betterPlayerDataSource: betterPlayerDataSource,
);

// 3. Display with advanced controls
BetterPlayer(controller: betterPlayerController)
```
